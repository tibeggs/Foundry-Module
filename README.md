# Chat Damage Buttons (5e)

This module replaces the right-click context menu with buttons on the dice-roll chat message. 
- I believe the workflow for applying damage to tokens is smoother with buttons compared to the right-click context menu method.
- There is a bug with the right-click context menu currently when using the bottom most chat-message. This approach provides a work around for this issue.
